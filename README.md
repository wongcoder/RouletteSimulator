# RouletteSimulator
Creating a game of roulette, which will then have a machine learning algorithm run through it to come up with effective ways of maximizing profit.

Was inspired after watching a quick video of Jabrils and losing a bunch of fake Internet money on roulette games. Maybe one day I will test out my model?

Currently following 0 wheel, can relase different implementations based on global constant in the future.

# C++ Implementation
Currently working on a quick implementation of a Roulette Wheel on C++. 

# Python Implementation
Haven't really worked with Python all that much outside of coding challenges, so will take a bit to learn better practices. Should be out in a day.
